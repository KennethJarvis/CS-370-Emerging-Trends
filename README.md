# CS-370-Emerging-Trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
	I was provided with code for a neural network using Keras for the MNIST dataset. It contained the basic needs, with three dense hidden layers and an output layer. The code can test accuracy and loss after training. I created code by modifying the hidden layers and testing its accuracy. By increasing the hidden layers, I was able to improve accuracy to 0.960. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
	Computer scientists work in fields such as data structures, cybersecurity, and software design. They concentrate on algorithm development, improving the efficiency of data processing and calculations. Computer scientists analyze massive amounts of data, look for patterns, and make predictions based on the results. The research matters because it takes current designs and finds ways to improve them. Technology is always progressing, and computer scientists ensure we are doing it efficiently and safely. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Computer scientists systematically approach problems. When analyzing problems, they ask questions like “What is the best possible outcome?” and “What is holding the system back?” They then break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts and work on fixing the sections. They will design a solution and a path to implement it. Then, they will study the results and repeat the process until they meet their goals. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
	A computer scientist handles massive amounts of data, and some ethical responsibilities come with the job. It is vital to safeguard sensitive information from prying eyes. Information getting into the wrong hands may be costly to the employer or employees. If security procedures leak, identity theft, fraud, corporate espionage, and loss of trust may result.
